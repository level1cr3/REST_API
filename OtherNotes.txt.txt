Great questions! Here are clear, beginner-friendly answers:

## 1. Should a repository using DbContext (ApplicationContext) be registered as **scoped**?

**YES, it should be registered as scoped.**

- **Why?**
  - `DbContext` in Entity Framework Core is designed to be used per HTTP request (per unit of work).
  - **Scoped** lifetime means one instance per HTTP request or logical operation.
  - If you make it **singleton**, you’ll share a single `DbContext` across all requests, which causes threading issues and incorrect data.
  - If you make it **transient**, you’ll get a new `DbContext` every time, which can break tracking and transactions.

**So:**
```csharp
services.AddScoped<IMyRepository, MyRepository>();
services.AddScoped<ApplicationContext>();
```

## 2. What does "has no state" mean? (Easy explanation)

- **"No state"** means the object **doesn’t remember anything between uses**.
- It doesn’t keep any data in fields or variables that change during its lifetime.

**Examples:**

- **Stateless:**  
  - A calculator class where every method just adds or multiplies numbers you give it, and doesn't keep track of previous results.
  - A service that always returns the current time.

- **Stateful:**  
  - A shopping cart object that remembers what items you’ve added.
  - A logger that remembers how many messages have been logged.

**In coding terms:**
```csharp
public class StatelessService
{
    public int Add(int a, int b) => a + b; // No fields, just does work
}

public class StatefulService
{
    private int _counter = 0; // This is state!
    public void Increment() => _counter++;
    public int GetValue() => _counter;
}
```

## 3. Why does this matter for Singleton/Scoped/Transient?

- **Singleton:** Share one instance for the whole app. Only safe for stateless or thread-safe state.
- **Scoped:** New instance per request. Good for things like `DbContext` or repositories.
- **Transient:** New instance every time. Good for lightweight, stateless services.

## **Summary Table**

| Lifetime    | Has State? | Example                             | When to use                |
|-------------|------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Singleton   | No         | Logger with no fields, config reader| Stateless, thread-safe     |
| Scoped      | Yes/No     | DbContext, Repositories             | Per-request dependencies   |
| Transient   | No         | Utility classes, calculators        | Lightweight, stateless     |

**TL;DR:**  
- **Repositories using DbContext should be Scoped.**
- "No state" = doesn’t remember anything between uses (no changing fields).
- Only Singleton stateless or thread-safe services.

Let me know if you want code examples!



- CancellationToken only works when you carry them all the way down to the inner most async method that accepts it.
- example from API endpoint to db query method.


- Authentication and Authorization.

> Authentication is the process of verifying who the user is.

> Authorization is the process of verifying what a user can do.




# How to decide where to put ratings. endpoints ?
> IF we see the api endpoints so far. we see that 'Movies' is our resource. and we can get this resource, update and delete etc.
> Now rating are directly attached to the movies they are not independent ressource. We are going to get the ratings for the movie 
> So in our case they will live inside the movies.
